Exploration of approaches for read and write object data to and from an ArrayBuffer. Useful for keeping object definitions in a compact form.

## TODO / Considerations

- Add constructor support to the struct definitions so a class can be instantiated instead of a basic object.
- Add support for variable length arrays
- Add support for strings
- Add support for seeking through an array
- Add example for reading and writing data of varying types of structs
- Add benchmarks
